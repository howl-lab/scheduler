## 05 Custom Scheduler

### The Project

To create a simple schedule application that users can use to save events and plan for hours of their day. This application will run in the browser and build from HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript. 

This app also utilized the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

### User Story

```md
AS someone with a things to do and keep track of
I WANT to add important notes to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time at a high level view
```

### Application Outline

```md
GIVEN I want to use a daily planner to plan out my day
WHEN I open the application
THEN the current time and day are shown at the top
WHEN I view at timeblocks for that day 
THEN each timeblock is color coded for the day to indicate whether a task/event is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click on a timeblock
THEN I can enter an input for that time
WHEN I click the save button for that time
THEN my event is saved even when the page refreshes
```
